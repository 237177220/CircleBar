# CircleBar
<font size=14>Everyday we use different APP, and I find some funny bar; So I think I can implement those by myself.
By this way I can understand how to use View or ViewGroup or RLT to define a CustomView and know about View's [OnMeasure,OnLayout,OnDraw](https://developer.android.com/training/custom-views/index.html)</font>

## CurrentStatus

&emsp;current status is blow, but there is some bug. I will improve them every day;
